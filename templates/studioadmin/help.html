    <h2>Tracks</h2>
    <p>
        Tracks represent categories of events that will be grouped together on the booking site.
        Each event type is associated with a single track (although event types can have the same names - e.g. an
        "aerial class" event type on the Adults track is different to an "aerial class" event type on the Kids track.

    <p>Events in each track will be shown on a different page.  Tracks with no scheduled events will not be visible on the site.</p>
        For example, you might have a track for Adults classes, Youth classes, Workshops, Parties etc.  As tracks
        will be displayed as menu options, it's best to try to choose concise descriptive names for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Choose one "default" track, which will be the landing page for the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Event Types</h2>
    <p>
    Event Types define general characteristics about an event, such as the number of participants and cancellation period.
    Scheduled events for particular days and times are generated from Event Types and will share those characteristics.  An
    Event Type must be associated with one Track.
    </p>
    <p>
    Event Types are used to define pricing for events, and can be associated with multiple Credit Block.
    For example, you might create an Aerial Class event type, in the Adult Classes track.  You can then set up
    multiple Credit Blocks attached to this event type to allow students to purchase credit in blocks of 1, 4 or 8 classes.
    </p>

    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>
    An Event is a single, scheduled event, which has a specific date and time, and which students can book into.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Types</h2>
    <p>
        Course Types define the outline of a Course, and hold the Event Type and the number of events in the course.
        They can be associated with Credit Blocks for courses, which will only allow students to book for classes in
        one course.
    </p>

    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <p>
        A course is a collection of scheduled events.  It is associated with a Course Type, which defines the number of events
        in the course and, by association with Credit Blocks, pricing for the course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students will initially book for a course and will be booked into all of its events.  They can choose to
        cancel from individual events, but won't be given credit back to their credit block to use for other events
        not in that course (although they will be able to re-book for the course event).
    </p>

    <h2>Credit Blocks</h2>
    <p>
        Credit blocks define pricing and come in two varieties
        <ul>
            <li>Drop In Credit Blocks which can be used for a number of events of a specific event type with a fixed time period</li>
            <li>Course Credit Blocks which can be used for a single course of a specifc course type</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Creating Scheduled Events</h1>
    <p>
        There are a number of ways to create scheduled events, once your tracks, event types and course types
        are set up.
        <ol>
            <li>Go to Events > Add Event to create a one-off event</li>
            <li>Clone an already created event</li>
            <li>Create a timetable of weekly sessions to bulk upload</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Cloning Events</h2>
    <p>
        This lets you set up an event once, and then duplicate it many times.  From the Events page, click the <i class="far fa-clone"></i> icon
        to clone an event.  You can select from options to clone
        the event at recurring days/times every week, at recurring intervals on a specific date, or as a single specific
        date and time.
    </p>

    <h2>Timetabled Sessions and Upload</h2>
    <p>
        Timetabled Sessions are similar to Events, but have a day of the week and time rather than a specific dates.
        Once set up, you can choose the dates you want to upload the entire timetable at once.
        Timetabled sessions can also be cloned, if you're creating multiple similar sessions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that uploaded, clones and newly created events are not immediately visible on the site by default.
        They can be switched to visible on the Events list page when you're happy with them.
    </p>

    <div class="anchor" id="managing">anchor</div>
    <h1>Managing Events</h1>
    <h2>Cancelling</h2>
    <p>
        If necessary, you can cancel an event from the Events page using the "Cancel" buttons.  You will be asked for
        confirmation first, and students booked into the event will be emailed notification (plus and optional
        message that you can add during on the cancellation page).
    </p>

    <h2>Contacting Students</h2>
    <p>From the Events and Courses pages, you also have the option to email students booked into an event/course.
        Click the <i class="far fa-envelope"></i> icon for the event you want to to email.
    </p>

    <h2>Registers</h2>
    <p>Registers give you a list of booked students for each event, with buttons to mark students as attended or
        not attended.  Note that students who cancel after the cancellation period are marked as booked but
        not attended and will be visible (greyed out) on the registers.
