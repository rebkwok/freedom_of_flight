GETTING HERE
Our studio can be hard to find on your first visit as we are off the main road. We have pinned
directions on our Facebook page to help you.

Some GPS and sat nav systems may not take you to the correct entrance, so please make sure you check the pinned directions. If you don’t have access
to Facebook please email for directions.

WHAT TO WEAR TO CLASS
For aerial class students must remove or cover all jewellery and tie back long hair. We recommend
you wear comfortable clothing for exercise and extra layers of clothing covering your knees,
stomach and arm pits are best. Clothing can get damaged on the equipment so please don’t wear your
best clothes to class. We also recommend you bring a water bottle with you for class.
